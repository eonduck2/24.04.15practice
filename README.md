# Captions about project
this project made the reason with the "how could i get the use the SCSS". basically, the purpose that i have to do this project jsut improve my ability with the use that SCSS training
maybe, i think SCSS is great processing way with the CSS, so i need to know that about syntaxes or grammers, whatever i need to know and i need to training.
even if, it's gonna take away my focuses i have to do this

# Why this
there is no other reason, it is what it is. cause i just get the information about SCSS lately, and i got so many interesting with that processing way.
when the strangers get question like "why you have to do this project ?, why you need to SCSS"
again it is with no other reason

# What i have created that used SCSS
the first thing is you can't check with the difference that when i get made the application with CSS
cause, my workspace is just only "Coding", it means that's even not a have to difference with "Browser"
i just worked for the "Cleaning Code", and it's gonna be clean and short

# Feedbacks
when i get started this work, i have to greed that a new "Stack".
but, it's not a good to way that a purpose for training
if i have and with nicest mind set, maybe i think i got the more more techniques from this project.
